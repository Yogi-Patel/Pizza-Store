# Pizza-Store
It is a text-based Pizza Ordering System written in Java  
When I wrote this, JDK 8 was the LTS but it works on JDK 11 as well.  
This is the first project I ever did in my life. &nbsp
If you do give it a try, there are many design flaws but the program is overall forgiving (you could enter something that the program does not expect and it lets you try again from the same point)
