# Pizza-Store
It is a text-based Pizza Ordering System written in Java  
It workds just fine on JDK 11   
This is the first project I ever did in my life.  
If you do give it a try, there are many design flaws but the program is overall forgiving (you could enter something that the program does not expect and it lets you try again from the same point)
